# Huffman-Codes
Implementation of the Huffman coding procedure in order to generate an optimal prefix code for a given text file. The program reads a specified text file and generates a binary codeword for each character appearing in the text. The resulting encoding of the character values will result in the smallest possible character-by-character encoding of the text file.
The Huffman encoding procedure generates a prefix code for a given text that will result in the shortest possible encoding. In particular, the Huffman procedure generates a tree represents the optimal encoding. Huffman’s procedure builds the tree from the leaves up. In order to implement the procedure, each node in the tree must additionally store a weight. The weight of a leaf is the frequency (i.e., number of occurances) of the corresponding character in the next. The weight of each internal node is the sum of the weights of its children. Thus, the root’s weight is the total number of characters in the text.
